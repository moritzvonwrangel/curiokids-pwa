If you saw Luma by the pond, you might think she was made of glass. Her wings are so thin and shiny, they catch the light like tiny windows.

Luma is a Japanese dragonfly who lives near a quiet countryside pond on Honshu island. She spends most of her time in the air, darting and diving like a tiny helicopter. Dragonflies have four wings that can move separately, helping them fly in all directions — even backward!

Luma’s huge eyes give her nearly full-circle vision. That helps her spot small flying insects, which she catches in midair using her legs like a net. Dragonflies are fast — some can fly up to 30 kilometers per hour.

Before Luma could fly, she lived underwater as a nymph. For nearly a year, she crawled along the pond bottom, eating small creatures. Then one day, she climbed up a reed, shed her skin, and became the shimmering flier you see now.

Why do you think dragonflies have lived on Earth for over 300 million years? Luma might not know — but her wings still tell a very old story.
