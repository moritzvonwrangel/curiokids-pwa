Meet Luma. Luma is a shiny dragonfly who lives near a quiet pond in Japan.

Her wings are thin and clear, like tiny windows. When she flies, they buzz and shimmer in the sun. Can you see how fast she zips through the air?

Luma has big eyes that help her see all around. She watches for little bugs to catch. Dragonflies don’t walk much — they love to fly!

In the morning, Luma sits on a leaf to rest. The leaf floats on the still water. Sometimes, frogs hop nearby. Sometimes, the wind makes little ripples.

Luma is small, but she’s quick and strong. She loves her warm pond and the tall green grasses where she can hide and wait.
