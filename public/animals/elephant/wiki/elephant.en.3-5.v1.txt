Meet Sally. Sally is a big, gray elephant who lives in Africa. She has thick, wrinkly skin and big, floppy ears. Can you see her long trunk? She uses it to smell, drink, and pick up food!

Sally walks slowly with her family. Elephants stay close together. They help each other and never leave anyone behind. When Sally is tired, she stays near her mother.

Sometimes, the sun is very hot. Sally flaps her ears to stay cool. She also loves water! When she finds a river, she splashes and sprays herself with her trunk.

Sally is still young, but one day she will be very big. She will help care for the little onesâ€”just like the grown-up elephants do now.
