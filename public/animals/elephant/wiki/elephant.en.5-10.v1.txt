Can you see Sally in the picture? She’s a young African elephant, walking with her herd across the hot, dry plains. Her big ears help her stay cool, and her strong trunk can lift heavy branches or spray water like a hose.

Sally lives with a group of elephants, called a herd. Her herd is made up of mothers, grandmothers, aunts, and babies. The oldest female leads the way and knows where to find water and food. Elephants are very social animals. They remember each other, play together, and even comfort one another when they’re sad.

Right now, Sally is learning everything she needs to grow up. She watches how the older elephants care for the group. When she’s bigger, she might become a leader too.

Elephants have great memories, deep family bonds, and amazing ways of talking—like low rumbles that humans can’t hear. What do you think Sally is learning today?
