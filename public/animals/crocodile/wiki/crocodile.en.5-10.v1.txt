Can you spot Kojo? He’s a young Nile crocodile, half-hidden in the muddy shallows of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. His rough, bumpy skin blends perfectly with the riverbank. Staying still helps him stay safe—and helps him hunt.

Kojo’s eyes and nose sit high on his head, so he can breathe and look around while almost completely underwater. His long, muscular tail powers him forward when he swims, and his short legs let him move surprisingly fast on land when needed.

Like many crocodiles, Kojo likes to sunbathe. But there’s a reason he opens his mouth while lying in the sun: it helps him cool down, since crocodiles can’t sweat.

Kojo is still young, but he’s learning to be patient. Crocodiles wait quietly, then strike quickly. He also stays near his mother, who protects her young for many months—one of the few reptiles that does.

Crocodiles have been around since the time of the dinosaurs. Isn’t it amazing how nature helps Kojo survive, just like his ancient ancestors?
