Kojo is a young crocodile. He lives in a big river with tall grass and soft mud. Can you see his rough, scaly skin? It helps him hide in the water.

Kojo has a long, strong tail. He swishes it back and forth to swim. His eyes sit high on his head. That way, he can peek out of the water while staying very still.

Sometimes, Kojo lies in the sun with his mouth wide open. That helps him cool down—just like taking off a warm jacket!

Kojo stays close to his family. He learns to wait, watch, and snap up little fish. Even when he’s still, Kojo is always paying attention.
